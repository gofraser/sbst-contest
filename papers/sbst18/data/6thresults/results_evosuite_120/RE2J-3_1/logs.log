  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 
  - Line 64
  - Branch 69
  - Exception 0
  - MutationFactory 148
  - Output 2
  - Method 1
  - MethodNoException 1
  - CBranchFitnessFactory 69
* Using seed 1516821024555
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 74s and 71 generations, 29845 statements, best individual has fitness: 309.8333333333333
* Minimizing test suite
* Generated 15 tests with total length 68
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 66% (average coverage for all fitness functions)
* Generating assertions
* Compiling and checking tests
