* EvoSuite 1.0.6-SNAPSHOT
* Going to generate test cases for class: com.google.re2j.Parser
* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 21057
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /var/benchmarks/projects/re2j/target/classes
  - /var/benchmarks/projects/re2j/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class com.google.re2j.Parser
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 
  - Line 786
  - Branch 668
  - Exception 0
  - MutationFactory 501
  - Output 5
  - Method 16
  - MethodNoException 16
  - CBranchFitnessFactory 668
* Using seed 1516823961438
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 72s and 46 generations, 23254 statements, best individual has fitness: 1809.733356567851
* Minimizing test suite
* Generated 51 tests with total length 826
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 55% (average coverage for all fitness functions)
