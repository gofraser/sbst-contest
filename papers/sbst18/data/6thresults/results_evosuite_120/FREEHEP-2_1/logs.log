* EvoSuite 1.0.6-SNAPSHOT
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.freehep.math.minuit.MnLineSearch
* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 20679
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /var/benchmarks/projects/freehep/math/freehep-jminuit/target/classes
  - /var/benchmarks/projects/freehep/math/freehep-jminuit/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.freehep.math.minuit.MnLineSearch
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 
  - Line 104
  - Branch 95
  - Exception 0
  - MutationFactory 132
  - Output 2
  - Method 1
  - MethodNoException 1
  - CBranchFitnessFactory 95
* Using seed 1516820794763
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 71s and 26 generations, 21806 statements, best individual has fitness: 99.45
* Minimizing test suite
* Generated 11 tests with total length 98
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 85% (average coverage for all fitness functions)
* Generating assertions
* Compiling and checking tests
* Writing JUnit test case 'MnLineSearch_ESTest' to temp/testcases
* Done!

* Computation finished
