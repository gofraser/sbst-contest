* EvoSuite 1.0.6-SNAPSHOT
* Going to generate test cases for class: com.google.re2j.Compiler
* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 20301
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /var/benchmarks/projects/re2j/target/classes
  - /var/benchmarks/projects/re2j/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class com.google.re2j.Compiler
* Test criteria:
  - Line Coverage
  - Branch Coverage
  - Exception
  - Mutation testing (weak)
  - Method-Output Coverage
  - Top-Level Method Coverage
  - No-Exception Top-Level Method Coverage
  - Context Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 
  - Line 123
  - Branch 115
  - Exception 0
  - MutationFactory 374
  - Output 2
  - Method 1
  - MethodNoException 1
  - CBranchFitnessFactory 115
* Using seed 1516821455430
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 76s and 74 generations, 35836 statements, best individual has fitness: 586.5654743953253
* Minimizing test suite
* Generated 25 tests with total length 130
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 67% (average coverage for all fitness functions)
* Generating assertions
* Compiling and checking tests
* Writing JUnit test case 'Compiler_ESTest' to temp/testcases
* Done!

* Computation finished
