=== Run Jacoco for Coverage ===
Number of instrumented file = 193
Running tests with the following classpath: 
/home/evosuite_6th/results_evosuite_120/OKHTTP-1_1/temp/testcases/classes_instrumented:/usr/local/bin/lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:/usr/local/bin/lib/junit-4.12.jar:/home/evosuite_6th/lib/evosuite-master-1.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar:/home/evosuite_6th/results_evosuite_120/OKHTTP-1_1/temp/testcases/bin
Running the tests: [SBSTDummyForCoverageAndMutationCalculation, okhttp3.Cookie_ESTest]
Executions terminated
Number of file with coverage information = 193
Extracted coverage data for the class okhttp3/Cookie

=== Run PIT ===
Generate mutations via PIT
 Running tests against generated Mutants
Running PITWrapper with the following data:
> CP = /usr/local/bin/lib/junit-4.12.jar:/usr/local/bin/lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:/var/benchmarks/projects/okhttp/okhttp/target/classes:/home/evosuite_6th/lib/evosuite-master-1.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar:/home/evosuite_6th/results_evosuite_120/OKHTTP-1_1/temp/testcases/bin
> CUT = okhttp3.Cookie
> Test cases = [okhttp3.Cookie_ESTest, okhttp3.Cookie_ESTest_scaffolding]
Matching Jacoco with PIT: find covered mutations
Run tests against the covered mutations (i.e., mutants infecting on covered lines according to Jacoco)
