=== Run PIT ===
Generate mutations via PIT
 Running tests against generated Mutants
Running PITWrapper with the following data:
> CP = /usr/local/bin/lib/junit-4.12.jar:/usr/local/bin/lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:/var/benchmarks/projects/commons-jxpath-1.3-src/target/classes:/home/evosuite_6th/lib/evosuite-master-1.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar:/home/evosuite_6th/results_evosuite_120/JXPATH-6_1/temp/testcases/bin
> CUT = org.apache.commons.jxpath.JXPathContext
> Test cases = [org.apache.commons.jxpath.JXPathContext_ESTest, org.apache.commons.jxpath.JXPathContext_ESTest_scaffolding]
Matching Jacoco with PIT: find covered mutations
Run tests against the covered mutations (i.e., mutants infecting on covered lines according to Jacoco)
